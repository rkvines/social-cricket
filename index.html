                    <h3>About <span id="user_about_name">Virat Kohali</span></h3>
                    <p id="user_About_descri_content">Virat Kohli had a dream. A dream like every other young kid in
                        India
                        to represent the country in the gentlemanâ€™s game. It is this vigor and fervor for the game of
                        cricket that has helped this extremely talented young boy from Delhi to scale great heights at a
                        very young age. He was barely in his teens when he led the India Under-19 team to a World Cup
                        victory in Kuala Lumpur in 2008 which was a pointer of bigger and better things to come in the
                        future. After that famous victory, it was not long before he made his entry into the senior team
                        and
                        Kohli was soon brushing shoulders with the best in the business and his cricketing idol Sachin
                        Tendulkar. The stylish right-handed batsman banked on the opportunities at disposal and
                        displayed a
                        tremendous sense of maturity as if to show he belonged. He was termed brash and aggressive for
                        being
                        expressive on and off the field, but Kohli imbibed all of those qualities in his gameplay only
                        to
                        become better with each passing game. He began chasing totals for India with ridiculous ease and
                        India had found a stable batsman in the middle order for the long run. Such is his batting
                        prowess
                        and cricketing mind that Ray Jennings(his coach with Royal Challengers Bangalore) touted him to
                        be
                        the leader of future India. Kohli made his mark in the shorter formats of the game but got a
                        chance
                        to don the whites in 2011. He registered his maiden Test century against Australia in Adelaide
                        in
                        January 2012 and followed it up with impressive centuries in India and abroad - namely South
                        Africa
                        and New Zealand.</p>
